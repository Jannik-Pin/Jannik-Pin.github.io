This is my first self made Pixel art maker. 

This project concludes all the knowledge i gained throughout the Udacity nano degree intro into Programming. 

Over 4 month I learned skills in html, CSS, Python and JavaSkript. 

For this topic I needed to use my learned skills in html and CSS but especially in JavaSkript. 

When you go to my website Jannik-Pin.github.io/ you will see the Pixel art maker Game. 

Feel free to choose any number in the grid width and grid height field ( as long as it is a number between 1 and 30 ) 

Once you choose the correct size of your preferred grid click submit. 

Next choose your favored color and you are good to go to draw around :) 

Note: you can choose different colors while drawing in the same grid. Also you can use a new color for already colored cells. 

When your master piece is done but you are just getting started, click on submit and you will get a ne grid :) 

Hope you will enjoy!!
